 <h2> Here are some reasons why you <strong>should</strong> get a dog:</h2> 
  <ul>
<li> They are <strong>great</strong> companions</li>
<li> You can <em>train</em> them</li>  
    <li> You can take them on walks which allows you to go outside</li>
    <li> They are <strong>playful</strong> and <strong>active</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Here is why you <strong>shouldn't</strong> get a dog:</h3>
    <ul>
<li> You have a lot of responsibility</li>
      <li> They require a lot of care and time</li>
<li> You have to train them to do certain things</li>
      <li> You need a place to put their bed, food/water bowls etc</li>
      <p> Dogs are very energetic and active so if you own a dog, you have a lot of responsibilites. You have to regularly give them a bath because they might get dirty from playing outside (if you let your dog go outside). You also have to decide on the correct breed because it depends on the temperature/weather.</p>
