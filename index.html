 <h2> Here are some reasons why you <strong>should</strong> get a dog:</h2> 
  <ul>
<li> They are <strong>great</strong> companions</li>
<li> You can <em>train</em> them</li>  
    <li> You can take them on walks which allows you to go outside</li>
    <li> They are <strong>playful</strong> and <strong>active</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h3> Here is why you <strong>shouldn't</strong> get a dog:</h3>
    <ul>
<li> You have a lot of responsibility</li>
      <li> They require a lot of care and time</li>
<li> You have to train them to do certain things</li>
      <li> You need a place to put their bed, food/water bowls etc</li>
    <li> You have to pay for the dog's food, vet visits and toys</li>
      <p> Dogs are very energetic and active so if you own a dog, you have a lot of responsibilites. You have to regularly give them a bath because they might get dirty from playing outside (if you let your dog go outside). You also have to decide on the correct breed because it depends on the temperature/weather.</p>
      <p> A dog is a domestic mammal of the family Canidae and the order Carnivora. Its scientific name is Canis lupus familiaris. Dogs are a subspecies of the gray wolf, and they are also related to foxes and jackals. Dogs are one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world. (Cats are the other.)</p>

<h1> Cats</h1>

<h2> Here is a list of reasons on why you <strong>should</strong> get a cat:</h2>  
<ul>
<li> They are calm/not as energetic and playful as dogs</li>
  <li> They are <strong>independent</strong></li>
  <li> They hunt for food by themselves so you only have to feed them once a day</li>
  <li> They don't require lots of bathes because they groom themselves. However, it's good to groom them once a week to keep them in good condition</li>
</ul>

  <h3> And here is a list of reasons why you <strong>shouldn't</strong> get a cat</h3>
  <ul>
<li> Cats are supposed to be left to roam around outside, if you keep them inside a lot, they will get bored and destructive</li>
    <li> Cats love scratching things so they might scratch furniture</li>
    <li> You have to pay for food, toys and visits to the vet</li>
    <li> Cats might bring back dead animals as "presents"</li>
    <li> If you let a cat in your house, there will be a lot of cat hair which can trigger asthma and some people are allergic to cats/dander (the small hairs in a cat or other hairy animals)</li>
    <p> Cats are graceful, <strong>carnivorous</strong> (meat-eating) mammals with sharp teeth and claws. Most kinds of cat prey on other mammals or birds, and most hunt alone at night. Only lions live and hunt in groups. The claws of cats are extended to help grip their prey, but retracted (pulled back) when not in use.</p>
